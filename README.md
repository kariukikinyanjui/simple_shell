This is a collaborative project to implement a simple shell.

A simple shell, also known as a command-line interface (CLI), is a text-based user interface that allows users to interact with a computer system by entering commands. It provides a way to execute commands, run programs, and perform various tasks using the command line.

In this project we will implement a UNIX command line interpreter
Handle command lines with arguments
Handle the PATH
Implement the exit built-in that exits the shell
Implement the env built-in that prints the current environment
Write our own getline function
Build our own strtok
Handle arguments for the built-in exit
Implement the setenv and unsetenv builtin commands
Implement the builtin command cd
Handle the commands separator
Handle the && and || shell logial operators
Implement the alias builtin command
Handle the variables replacement
Handle the $? variable
Handle the $$ variable
Handle comments (#)
